                Through some of my codes, you can find that I was following a pattern, I conclude something via learning.

                    Load the data and wrap all the others into the function
                </div>

                    Create a kind-of box model for the SVG element.

                    Create the SVG element.

                <div class="item">
                    Create the scale for each dimension.
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    Create the component of D3 like (arc, histogram, etc)
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    Append the SVG to DOM

                <div class="item">
                    Create x and y axies and append them to DOM
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Initially, I think it was easy. But when I actually coding, I found that it is not the same story.
                Roughly speaking, I learn d3 in a hard way. I soon realize that I was coding based on v4 which was
                release just a month ago. And the documents are not comprehensive. They just explain all the API, but not
                explain how to chain the methods of component to actually form a component.
            </p>
            <p>
                The damn thing about such a weak typed language like javascript is, you never know what actually you need to
                pass and what object does the function return. If the author doesn't mention, you need dive into the source
                code to figure it out which is very time consuming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally glad that I made it. I know there are other chart library out there which is far more easier
                than D3, But, just love challenges.

            <p>I changed 3 times then get my final laptop. A 2012 model macbook pro. Sucks at speed, but it works.
            But due to the lack of time, there are so much things that I could Improve. Things like:</p>
